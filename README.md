Web Scraper App Project
This is the README file for the Web Scraper App project, which is built using Django. The Web Scraper App is a web application that allows users to scrape and extract data from websites. It provides a user-friendly interface for configuring web scraping tasks, executing them, and viewing the scraped data.

Features
Website Configuration: Users can configure the details of the website they want to scrape, including the URL, specific HTML elements to extract, and the data fields they want to save.

Data Extraction: The app uses web scraping techniques to extract data from the specified website. Users can define CSS selectors or XPath expressions to locate the desired HTML elements.

Task Management: Users can create, edit, and delete scraping tasks. Each task represents a specific website and the associated data extraction rules.

Scheduled Scraping: The app allows users to schedule scraping tasks to run at specified intervals. This enables automated data extraction without manual intervention.

Data Visualization: The scraped data is displayed in a user-friendly manner, such as tables or charts, allowing users to easily analyze and interpret the extracted information.

Exporting Data: Users can export the scraped data in various formats, such as CSV or JSON, for further analysis or integration with other systems.

User Authentication and Authorization: The app provides user registration and authentication features. Users can have different roles (e.g., admin, regular user) with varying levels of access and permissions.
